                Sunspots, dark regions appearing on the surface of the Sun, were the first features to
                be observed on the Sun. Sunspots are formed when magnetic field lines emerge through 
                the photosphere preventing heat transport by convection. Observations of sunspots have 
                revealed several characteristics that are important to understanding the physical 
                mechanisms of the solar activity cycle. Sunspots were used to determine that the Sun 
                rotates in 27 days (or 1 Carrington Rotation). Sunspots usually occur in groups known 
                as active regions, which have a leading polarity where the magnetic field emerges and 
                a following polarity where the magnetic field submerges. Active regions follow Joy’s 
                Law, which says that sunspot groups have a tilt that changes with latitude and is such
                that the leading spots are more equatorward than the following spots. Sunspots groups
                also have opposite polarity from north to south and this polarity changes from cycle
                to cycle. This effect is known as Hale’s Polarity Law.

				c) Sunspot groups have opposite polarity from north to south and polarity changes
