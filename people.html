<h2 class="BlueHeader">Discover the People!</h2>

<div class="home_body">This website was developed and is maintained by two solar physicsts: <a href="#Upton"> Dr. Lisa Upton</a> and <a href="#Hathaway"> Dr. David Hathaway</a>. We both study <a href="activeregions.html"> Active Regions</a> and <a href="flows.html"> flows</a> on the Sun and are interested in how these components work together to produce the <a href="solarcycle.html"> Solar Activity Cycle</a>. Together, we have developed a state of the art surface flux transport model known as the Advective Flux Transport, or <a href="aft.html">AFT</a>, model. We use the model to study the Sun and to make <a href="forecasts.html">predictions</a> about the Sun.<br />
<br />
We have created this website in order to share our knoweldge and love of the Sun and our data with both the general public and our fellow scientists alike. We hope you enjoy your visit here!!!<br />
<br />
This page includes a bio for both us as well as links to many of <a href="#Papers"> our papers</a>.</div>

</div>
Dr. Hathaway received a B.S. in Astronomy in 1973 from the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, an M.S. in Physics in 1975 and a Ph.D. in Astrophysics in 1979 - both from the University of Colorado in Boulder. He was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Advanced Study Program at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder from 1979 to 1981 and then moved to Sunspot, New Mexico where he was an Assistant Astronomer at the National Solar Observatory. In 1984 he moved to Huntsville, Alabama where he was an Astrophysicist at NASA&#39;s Marshall Space Flight Center and served as the head of the Solar Physics Branch from 1996 to 2010. In July of 2014 he relocated to NASA&rsquo;s Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California. He retired from NASA on December 31, 2016 but still continues to work on his areas of interest.<br />
<br />
His research interests include observing, modeling, and predicting the sunspot cycle, and understanding the magnetohydrodynamics of the Sun&rsquo;s interior and how it produces the Sun&rsquo;s atmospheric features. He has published over 200 papers and has three US patents.<br />
<br />
Dr. Hathaway was a 40-year member of the Solar Physics Division of the American Astronomical Society. He served as the Division&rsquo;s Vice-Chairperson, Secretary, Committee Member, Media Liaison, and Chaired its Hale and Harvey Prize Committee. He was also a member of the International Astronomical Union, the American Geophysical Union, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the Asia Oceania Geoscience Society. He has received dozens of awards from NASA, including the NASA Inventor of the Year Award in 2002 for Video Image Stabilization And Registration (VISAR) and the NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal in 2014 for his discoveries of the Sun&rsquo;s shallow meridional return flow and giant convection cells. He also received the Space Foundation&rsquo;s Space Technology Hall of Fame Medal in 2001 for VISAR.<br />

<h2 class="BlueHeader">Discover Lisa Upton!</h2>

</div>
Dr. Upton began her education in Solar Physics working with Dr. Joan Schmelz at the University of Memphis in 2006. There, she performed thermal and density analysis of coronal loops using data from CDS, TRACE, EIS and XRT. In 2008, Lisa received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Physics and in 2010 she received her M.S. degrees in Physics from UM. While there, she became interested in another aspect of solar physics: the solar activity cycle.<br />
<br />
During the summer of 2009, Dr. Upton had an internship at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, where she began working with <a href="#Hathaway"> Dr. David Hathaway</a> using feature tracking to measure the axisymmetric flows on the surface of the Sun. This fruitful collaboration resulted in a paper in Science and after completing her Masters, Dr. Upton relocated to Huntsville to continue her work with Hathaway. In 2012, Dr. Upton received her 2nd Masters in Physics from the University of Alabama in Huntsville and was hired on as a Research Associate.<br />
<br />
In 2013, Dr. Upton transferred to Vanderbilt University while continuing her work with Dr. Hathaway in Huntsville. In May of 2014, she received her Ph.D. in Physics from Vanderbilt University. For her PhD dissertation (Characterizing and Modeling Magnetic Flux Transport in the Sun&rsquo;s Photosphere and Determining Its Impact on the Sunspot Cycle), Dr. Upton and Dr. Hathaway worked together to develope a cutting edge Surface Flux Transport model, the Advective Flux Transport (<a href="aft.html"> AFT</a>). Dr. Upton used the AFT model to investigate the importance of high latitude meridional flow variations in modulating the solar cycle as well as the ability of AFT to produce solar cycle predictions.<br />
<br />
September of 2014, Dr. Upton relocated to Colorado. There she began working for Space Systems Research Corporation and held a role as a Visiting Scientist at HAO. In the spring of 2017, Dr. Upton began a NSF postdoctoral fellowship* at HAO, working as a collaborator with the dynamo group. Dr. Upton&#39;s current research goals are aimed at understanding the solar dynamo, solar cycle variability, and the impact on the Sun-Earth environment. In particular her interests lie in observing and modeling magnetic flux transport. In the future, Lisa hopes advance Sun-Earth system research by bridging the solar interior and the solar atmosphere with AFT. She also hope to use AFT as a tool to improve Space Weather and Space Climate predictions.<br />

<figure class="text-center"><img alt="missing" src="bin/BKJha.jpg" width="50%" /></figure>
</div>
Dr. Bibhuti Kumar Jha received his B.Sc. (Hons) degree in Physics in 2014 and his M.Sc. (Hons) in 2016, both from the University of Delhi, New Delhi, India. He then joined  Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore, India for Ph.D. in solar astrophysics under the guidance of Prof. Dipankar Banerjee. In 2020, Dr. Jha moved to the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), Nainital, India, to continue his doctoral research, finally earning his Ph.D. in 2022. Following this, in January 2023,  he joined the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in Boulder as a Postdoctoral Researcher, where he is working with Dr. Lisa Upton on studying the Sun and its variability using surface flux transport (SFT) models.<br />
<br />
Dr. Jha's research interests include the development of automatic algorithms for identifying magnetic features such as sunspots, plages, and filaments in solar images. He also focuses on modeling solar cycle variability using the SFT models, measuring surface flow from multi-wavelength observations, and applying Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in heliophysics. Notably, he has developed AutoTAB, an automatic Bipolar Magnetic Region (BMR) tracking algorithm for solar images.<br />
